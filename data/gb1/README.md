## Dataset Description
The dataset includes mutations in the sites V39, D40, G41, V54 and the fitness score is normalized.

## Visualizations
The following visualizations are generated:

### Label Distribution

*Linear normalization used*

### Sequence Length Distribution
![Sequence Length Distribution](./plots/gb1_seq_len.png)
*Length is constant (265)*

### Number of Mutations Distribution
