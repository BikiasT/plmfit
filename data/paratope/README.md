## Paratope Dataset Description
This dataset is a selection of sequences from the SabDab database. It was selected as part of the ATUE benchmark to compare the performance of PLMs on antibody specific tasks.

### Biological Context
The paratope is the part of the antibody sequence that binds to an epitope on an antigen.

## Score Interpretation
