## Meltome Dataset Description
The Meltome dataset offers an extensive collection of data related to protein sequences and their stability across various conditions. Emphasis is placed on understanding the thermal stability and structural integrity of proteins under different environmental factors.

### Biological Context
The Meltome dataset compiles data from a wide range of organisms, providing insights into how proteins maintain their functionality under thermal stress. This dataset is instrumental in advancing our knowledge of protein behavior, especially in response to temperature changes.

## Dataset Processing
The dataset is processed to focus on relevant attributes such as sequence length, target scores, and dataset categorization. Sequences with big lengths (over 1000 amino acids) are dropped out of the dataset. The final processed dataset is saved as `meltome_data_full.csv` for comprehensive analysis.
